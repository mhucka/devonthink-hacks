# Unset field values

These small programs are meant to be installed in DEVONthink's AppleScripts menu. They are meant to be invoked by selecting records, then running the desired command.

* [`Unset Finder comment`](<Unset Finder comment.applescript>): I use the `Finder comment` metadata field value in specific ways in DEVONthink, and sometimes need to unset the value from a bunch of records at once. This script does that for the selected records.
* [`Unset URL`](<Unset URL.applescript>): unsets the _URL_ field on the selected records.
* [`Unset Aliases`](<Unset Aliases.applescript>): Ditto for the _Aliases_ field.

In my approach to using DEVONthink, I set a variety of custom fields to store data retrieved from Zotero, a research bibliography management system. Since these fields are not part of DEVONthink by default, and must be defined by the user, and most people probably don't use Zotero or my program [Zowie](https://github.com/mhucka/zowie), the next program is probably not relevant to anyone but me.

* [`Unset common Zotero field values`](<Unset common Zotero field values>): does the same as the programs above, and in addition, unsets custom fields such as `citekey`, `abstract`, `year`, and more.
