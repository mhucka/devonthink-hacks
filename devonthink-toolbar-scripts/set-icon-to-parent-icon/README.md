# Set the icon of a selected group to that of its parent

I like to set my group icons in DEVONthink to colorful custom icons. Copy-pasting icons using the inspector has become tedious, so I wrote a script to set the icon of a selected group to that of its parent. The AppleScript code in this directory was made possible thanks to helpful examples and comments from users "pete31" and "chrillek" on the DEVONthink user forums, in these postings:

* [AppleScript to set thumbnail of group to same as parent group?](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/applescript-to-set-thumbnail-of-group-to-same-as-parent-group/69114/3) (code to set thumbnails of child items)
* [AppleScript to set thumbnail of group to same as parent group?](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/applescript-to-set-thumbnail-of-group-to-same-as-parent-group/69114/11) (reminder about `location group`)
* [How to set thumbnails as raw data?](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/how-to-set-thumbnails-as-raw-data/55696)

I put the compiled script in the folder for DEVONthink menubar scripts (which is `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.devon-technologies.think3/Menu/`).
