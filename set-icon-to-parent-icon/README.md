# Set the icon of a selected group to that of its parent

I like to set my group icons in DEVONthink to colorful custom icons. Copy-pasting icons using the inspector has become tedious, so I wanted to try write a script to set the icon of a selected group to that of its parent. The AppleScript code in this directory was made possible thanks to helpful examples and comments from user "pete31" on the DEVONthink user forums, in these postings:

* [AppleScript to set thumbnail of group to same as parent group?](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/applescript-to-set-thumbnail-of-group-to-same-as-parent-group/69114/3)
