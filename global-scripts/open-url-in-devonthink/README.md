Open current Safari location in DEVONthink
==========================================

This is a small script to open in DEVONthink the page that is currently visible in Safari.  It is basically identical to creating a bookmark for the current URL then opening the bookmark in a separate DEVONthink window.  This is handy when you want to convert a page to PDF in DEVONthink but the site requires a login session: if you log into the website _within DEVONthink itself_, you can then navigate normally and save web pages while having the benefit of having a normal login session active.

This short AppleScript program is currently written specifically to work with Safari and Google Chrome, but it could easily be made more general to support other browsers too.
