# Note: the recommended approach for using this file is to add only project-
# specific rules to the .gitignore of a repository. Each user should put rules
# that apply to their tools and ways of working into a global git ignore file
# using (e.g.) "git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global".
# The rationale for this is that a number of file types, such as Emacs
# checkpoint and backup files, are things that are not specific to a given
# project; rather, Emacs creates them everywhere, in all projects, because
# they're a byproduct of how Emacs works. Thus, rules to ignore them belong
# in a user's own global .gitignore file, not in a project's .gitignore.
# A useful starting point for global .gitignore file contents can be found
# at https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global (as of 2022-07-14)
