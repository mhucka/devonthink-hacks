## Introduction

In the process of using [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) more fully, I've been developing scripts to automate various procedures. This repository contains the results.


## Installation and usage

There is no one-shot installation procedure nor a single usage procedure for all of these hacks. Please check each subdirectory separately; there is a README file that explains what needs to be done for each case.


## Known issues and limitations

The solutions and code in this repository were developed over a period of years spanning multiple releases of [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) in my sometimes idiosyncratic macOS environment. While they work for me (or did at the time I put them here), it is possible they will not work in your environment or in the version of DEVONthink that you are using. Caveat utilitor!


## Getting help

If you find an issue, please submit it in [the GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/mhucka/devonthink-hacks/issues) for this repository.


## Contributing

I would be happy to receive your help and participation with enhancing the solutions and code contained here.  Please visit the [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for some tips on getting started.
