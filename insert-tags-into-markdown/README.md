# Insert tags into Markdown document

The original code for this script came from a [posting by Christian Grunenberg during 2020-04](https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/help-with-a-way-script-to-copy-dt-tags-to-first-line-of-md-file/55057/2) to the DEVONthink user forums.  

To use this, I copy the AppleScript into the action of a smart rule, as an embedded script.
